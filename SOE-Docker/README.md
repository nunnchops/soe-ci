Jenkins Mock httpd CII Docker Image
===================================

This is a Jenkins, Mock, httpd SOE-CII  Docker image intended for use with [OpenShift v3](https://github.com/openshift/origin)

For an example of how to use it, [see this sample.](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/README.md)

The image is not present in Dockerhub at this time as it is experimental and 
needs to be split out into more rational images.
